## Hello Everyone.

My name is Cameron. I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer and I have quite a few accomplishments for someone of my age, however I have a _lot_ to learn if I want to make it in the professional scene.

Therefore decided to start writing a blog on the subjects I learn.
I need to warm up and practice my JS
And what better way to learn than get critique than from the masses of the internet?!

So I'm going to try this out. Maybe I'll learn how to write more eloquently, maybe I'll learn to code better, maybe I'll breakdown. Who knows?!

I'm happy to try it though!


See ya next time!

Cameron
