Well, we finished our first stream.

<!-- [_Here's a link of the video if you want to see._](https://youtu.be/WeBUdmNEdRI) -->

It did not go as well as had hoped.<br>
I stuttered, only recorded in 480p, was quiet for too long, forgot much of what I wanted to do and say, and blanked on basic HTML programming that I never should have forgotten in the first place. <br>
However, we got through it! And that's what matters!

Just as I said in a [previous post](https://codesquawk.me/hello-world/)

> Doing something is the first step to learning it.

So, some things I learned today

* Input will always be a string
* In Vanilla JS at least, there is no decent way to manipulate an interval to start or stop it.
  * The solution we came up with was to declare the variable outside the function and call it that way.
* I forgot how to create a basic form so we first used `document.querySelector` on the form itself and caught the submit action, then used `document.querySelector` on the input and received the input that way. I feel like there should be a better way of doing it.

I uploaded everything we did on github [**HERE**](https://github.com/Ecleptic/Interval-Timer/tree/093586ec2787a837d5dbd35b45d5e6fa6afc7133) if you would like to take a look.

As always, I'd love to hear what you guys think so far! Go ahead and use the contact form at the bottom ðŸ‘‡ and let me know what you think!

Thanks Everyone!
