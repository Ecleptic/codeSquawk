Recently I came to the conclusion that I needed to practice specific development strategies more. Most of what I am struggling with is in data structure work, styling, design, and documentation. And I am taking classes specifically to learn the basic data manipulation. However I still need to work on everything else.

> That's where you come in.

I am going to begin programming on a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ecleptic) stream. If writing my thoughts out on a blog form is a good way to learn, then wouldn't real-time feedback while programming be useful? Actually I don't know. However I do realize that it can be good to speak out loud my problems and thought-processes.

I plan on finding a steady schedule soon, however for now I will program when it fits the schedule and then upload them to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUMgB4tI3vuVfZMYyz0EBQ) where I will keep my videos for all posterity. _oh boy_

Some projects I'd like to work on are:

* [ ] An interval timer PWA<sup>\*</sup>
* [ ] An image gallery supporting image upload to AWS or some other CMS specifically for images
* [ ] Maybe a nice note-taking app that lets you link to other notes and supports a file/folder structure <sub>(using tags?)</sub>
* [ ] A music player connected to spotify/google/apple music APIs which would let groups of people add songs to a queue
* [ ] Something with a user side and an admin panel
* [ ] Something in React Native
* [ ] A jackbox-type game

That's a lot, and I may _never_ get to all of them, but they'll be fun to make and Every one of them I will learn something new.

First I'm going to start easy with the interval timer.

So come join me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ecleptic) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUMgB4tI3vuVfZMYyz0EBQ)!! üòÅ

See you there!
