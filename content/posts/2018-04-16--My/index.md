Three weeks ago I got a call from capital one, it was a getting to know you _interview_. I spoke with my recruiter about my experiences and desires for employment. At the end of the conversation I was invited to one of the Virgina campuses for an interview. I was estatic. I bought [a book for preparation and began studying.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Today I got the second call. I was rejected from the capital one TDP program. In this article I will attempt go over what I learned and try to notate everything I can improve upon for next time.

All questions I state are made up. Or from the [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.).

There were 3 parts to the interview. Technical, Behavioral, and a Case Study.

The technical and behavioral weâ€™re fairly standard. They asked me a series of questions based upon past projects and basic programming functions.

The case study is where I don't truly know how I did. I'd never heard of a technical case study before. They would give me an open-ended prompt and ask me to expand upon it, or give as much about an experience as possible. It was very difficult to gage whether I was going the right direction.
